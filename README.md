# Hubbard Operator Algebra
This library creates a python class defining Hubbard operators which are an alternative expression for Fock Space creation and anhilation Operators specifically defined on a lattice. It works on the LaTeX expression of the operators which is stored in a array like structure and can be used to calculate the sum, difference and product between any two operators and thereby their commutators. This can also been used to calculate all possible sets of commutators between two or more operators with another defined function in the library.

To use the library add the script hub_op.py to the folder where you want to use the library. Now import the library using import hub_op and you will be able to use the functions in the library. See examples to see how the library can be used.
